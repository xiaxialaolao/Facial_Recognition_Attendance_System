# Original Intention

My personal experience of failing to pass the facial recognition verification when registering for a payment software sparked my strong interest in biometric technology, and it also became an opportunity for me to choose "Facial Recognition Attendance System Based on Raspberry Pi" as my graduation project. During the project, I not only studied the face detection and recognition algorithm in depth, but also explored related technologies such as hardware deployment, image acquisition, and identity authentication.

Despite the challenges of algorithm mismatch with Raspberry Pi performance, low recognition accuracy, and insufficient data quality, I gradually overcame these technical difficulties through continuous debugging and optimization. The project uses Raspberry Pi as a platform, combines cameras, OpenCV, Python, and facial recognition libraries to build a system, and learns the importance of algorithm optimization, system module decoupling, and stability design in actual deployment.

This is not only a technical practice, but also a valuable process of turning personal experience into motivation and deeply understanding the principles and challenges of facial recognition systems.
